  - Automatic execution via GitHub Actions before app deployment
  - Version tracking in `goose_db_version` table
  - Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
  - Simple rollback support
  - Deployment blocked if migrations fail (ensures safety)

- **Migration Directory**: `internal/db/migrations/`
  - `000_init_schema.sql` - Initial placeholder migration
  - `001_customer_payment_methods.sql` - Payment methods and customer data
  - `002_transactions.sql` - Transaction records and audit trail
  - `003_chargebacks.sql` - Chargeback management

**Creating New Migrations:**
```bash
# Using goose CLI
goose -dir internal/db/migrations create add_new_feature sql

# Manual creation
# Create: internal/db/migrations/008_description.sql
```

**Local Migration Testing:**
```bash
# Local database
goose -dir internal/db/migrations postgres "postgresql://localhost:5432/payment_service" up

# Via Fly.io proxy (staging)
flyctl proxy 5432 -a kevin07696-payment-service-staging-db
goose -dir internal/db/migrations postgres "postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/payment_service" up
```

### Added - Browser Post Form Generator Endpoint (2025-11-06)

**Implemented Browser Post form data generator endpoint for frontend integration**

- **New HTTP Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/payments/browser-post/form?amount=99.99`
  - Generates form configuration with EPX credentials for Browser Post payments
  - Returns JSON with all required fields for frontend to construct payment form
  - Automatically generates unique transaction numbers
  - PCI-compliant: card data never touches merchant backend

- **Handler Implementation**: `internal/handlers/payment/browser_post_callback_handler.go`
  - Added `GetPaymentForm()` method to existing Browser Post callback handler
  - Validates amount parameter and format
  - Returns EPX credentials, transaction details, and callback URL
  - Uses configuration from environment variables

- **Configuration Updates**: `cmd/server/main.go`
  - Added EPX credentials to Config struct:
    - `EPXCustNbr` (default: "9001" for sandbox)
    - `EPXMerchNbr` (default: "900300" for sandbox)
    - `EPXDBAnbr` (default: "2" for sandbox)
    - `EPXTerminalNbr` (default: "77" for sandbox)
  - Added `CallbackBaseURL` for Browser Post callbacks (default: "http://localhost:8081")
  - Updated handler initialization to pass credentials

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `EPX_CUST_NBR` - EPX Customer Number
  - `EPX_MERCH_NBR` - EPX Merchant Number
  - `EPX_DBA_NBR` - EPX DBA Number
  - `EPX_TERMINAL_NBR` - EPX Terminal Number
  - `CALLBACK_BASE_URL` - Base URL for callback endpoint

- **Example API Usage**:
  ```bash
  # Request form configuration
  curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/payments/browser-post/form?amount=99.99

  # Response
  {
    "postURL": "https://secure.epxuap.com/browserpost",
    "custNbr": "9001",
    "merchNbr": "900300",
    "dBAnbr": "2",
    "terminalNbr": "77",
    "amount": "99.99",
    "tranNbr": "12345",
    "tranGroup": "SALE",
    "tranCode": "SALE",
    "industryType": "E",
    "cardEntMeth": "E",
    "redirectURL": "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/payments/browser-post/callback",
    "merchantName": "Payment Service"
  }
  ```

- **Comprehensive Testing**: `internal/handlers/payment/browser_post_form_handler_test.go`
  - **95.2% test coverage** for `GetPaymentForm()` function
  - Table-driven tests covering success and error scenarios
  - HTTP method validation (GET required, POST/PUT/DELETE rejected)
  - Amount parameter validation (missing, invalid, edge cases)
  - Unique transaction number generation verified
  - Credentials configuration tested across environments
  - Edge cases: zero amount, negative amount, decimal precision, empty parameters
  - Performance benchmark: ~6.7μs per request, 5.8KB memory allocation

- **Test Results**:
  ```
  ✅ TestGetPaymentForm (9 subtests) - All passing
  ✅ TestGetPaymentForm_UniqueTransactionNumbers - Verified microsecond precision
  ✅ TestGetPaymentForm_CredentialsConfiguration (3 environments) - All passing
  ✅ TestGetPaymentForm_EdgeCases (7 edge cases) - All passing
  ✅ BenchmarkGetPaymentForm - 158,158 ops/sec
  ```

- **Verification**:
  - ✅ `go build` - Compiles successfully
  - ✅ `go vet` - No issues detected
  - ✅ `go test` - All tests passing
  - ✅ Test coverage - 95.2% for new function

**Note**: This endpoint is designed for frontend integration. Frontend uses the returned configuration to build an HTML form that posts directly to EPX, keeping card data PCI-compliant by never sending it to the merchant backend.

  - ✅ **BRIC Storage (CCE8)**: Convert Financial BRIC to Storage BRIC - APPROVED
    - Successfully used $0.00 Account Verification
    - Storage BRIC tokens generated successfully
  - ✅ **Recurring Payment**: Sale with Storage BRIC - APPROVED
    - Fixed with ORIG_AUTH_GUID + ACI_EXT="RB"
    - AUTH_CODE: 057583, AVS: A (Address Match)

- **Test Environment**:
  - Endpoint: https://secure.epxuap.com
  - Credentials: CUST_NBR=9001, MERCH_NBR=900300, DBA_NBR=2, TERMINAL_NBR=77
  - Test Cards: Visa 4111111111111111, Mastercard 5499740000000057
  - Test Script: `test_all_transactions.go`

- **Key Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed BRIC Storage amount validation (allow $0.00 for Account Verification)
  - Verified all transaction type codes (CCE1, CCE2, CCE4, CCE9, CCEX, CCE8)
  - Confirmed XML response parsing for all transaction types

### Research - 3D Secure Provider Analysis (2025-01-05)

**Completed comprehensive 3DS provider research for EPX/North integration**

- **Research Objective**: Identify compatible 3DS authentication providers for EPX payment gateway
- **Key Finding**: EPX receives 3DS data but does not perform authentication - requires external 3DS provider
- **Documentation Created**: `3DS_PROVIDER_RESEARCH.md` with detailed analysis

**Providers Evaluated**:
1. **Cybersource + Cardinal Commerce** (Recommended)
   - ✅ Direct partnership with North American Bancard
   - ✅ Integrated fraud management + payer authentication
   - ✅ EMVCo certified, PSD2 SCA compliant
   - Best fit for EPX ecosystem

2. **Cardinal Commerce / Visa Acceptance Platform**
   - Industry standard with 20,718+ customers
   - 3.90% market share in payments processing
   - Platform migration to Visa Acceptance Platform by June 2025

3. **Stripe Standalone 3DS**
   - API-level control over 3DS authentication
   - Supports independent processors
   - Best developer experience

4. **Adyen 3DS Authentication Service**
   - Advanced authentication optimization
   - Platform-agnostic MPI support
   - Premium enterprise tier

5. **GPayments ActiveMerchant MPI**
   - Dedicated MPI specialist with 20+ years experience
   - EMVCo certified
   - Platform-agnostic solution

**EPX Integration Requirements**:
- Required fields: TDS_VER, CAVV_RESP, CAVV_UCAF, DIRECTORY_SERVER_TRAN_ID, TOKEN_TRAN_IDENT
- Transaction types: CCE1 (Sale), CCE2 (Authorization Only)
- Merchant profile must be configured as "Ecommerce"

**Implementation Estimates**:
- Timeline: 7-12 weeks (vendor selection to production)
- Estimated cost for 10K transactions/month: $700-$1,900
- Components: Frontend SDK + Backend API + EPX field mapping

**Next Steps**:
- Contact North American Bancard re: Cybersource 3DS integration
- Evaluate Stripe Standalone 3DS as alternative
- Plan proof of concept in test environment

**Current Status**: 3DS support is optional - existing payment flows work fine without it. Can be added later as enhancement when business needs dictate (fraud reduction, SCA compliance, international expansion).

### Added - Storage BRIC Conversion Implementation (2025-11-04)

**Implemented EPX BRIC Storage API for saving payment methods**

- **New BRIC Storage Port Interface** (`internal/adapters/ports/bric_storage.go`):
  - ✅ Created `BRICStorageAdapter` port for BRIC Storage operations
  - ✅ Supports converting Financial BRICs to Storage BRICs
  - ✅ Supports creating Storage BRICs from account information
  - ✅ Supports updating existing Storage BRIC reference data
  - **Why**: Storage BRICs never expire and are used for recurring payments and saved payment methods
  - **Impact**: Enables customers to save payment methods for future use

- **Extended Server Post API Support**:
  - ✅ Added `TransactionTypeBRICStorageCC` (CCE8) for credit card Storage BRIC
  - ✅ Added `TransactionTypeBRICStorageACH` (CKC8) for ACH Storage BRIC
  - ✅ Extended `ServerPostRequest` with BRIC Storage specific fields:
    - Account information fields (ACCOUNT_NBR, ROUTING_NBR, EXP_DATE, CVV)
    - Billing information fields (FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP_CODE)
    - Card entry method (CARD_ENT_METH)
    - Industry type (INDUSTRY_TYPE)
  - ✅ Extended `ServerPostResponse` with Network Transaction ID (NTID)
  - **Why**: EPX BRIC Storage requires additional fields for Account Verification
  - **Files Changed**: `internal/adapters/ports/server_post.go`

- **Payment Method Service Enhancement**:
  - ✅ Added `ConvertFinancialBRICToStorageBRIC()` method to `PaymentMethodService` interface
  - ✅ Created `ConvertFinancialBRICRequest` with billing information for Account Verification
  - **Use Case**: Customer completes payment and wants to save payment method
  - **Process Flow**:
    1. User completes Browser Post transaction → receives Financial BRIC
    2. User clicks "Save payment method"
    3. Backend calls `ConvertFinancialBRICToStorageBRIC()`
    4. For credit cards: EPX performs $0.00 Account Verification with card networks
    5. For ACH: EPX validates routing number
    6. If approved: Storage BRIC saved to `customer_payment_methods` table
  - **Files Changed**: `internal/services/ports/payment_method_service.go`

- **Key Technical Details**:
  - **Credit Cards**:
    - EPX routes Storage BRIC requests as $0.00 Account Verification (CCx0) to Visa/MC/Discover/Amex
    - Issuer must approve for Storage BRIC creation (enforces Network card-on-file requirements)
    - Returns Storage BRIC + Network Transaction ID (NTID) for compliance
    - Account Verification validates: ACCOUNT_NBR, EXP_DATE, ADDRESS (AVS), ZIP_CODE (AVS), CVV2
  - **ACH**:
    - Simpler process - EPX performs internal routing number validation only
    - No network validation required
    - Returns Storage BRIC immediately if routing number valid
  - **Storage BRIC Lifecycle**:
    - Never expires (indefinite lifetime)
    - One-time fee (billed 1 month in arrears by EPX business team)
    - Can be used for recurring payments and card-on-file
    - Important: When updating Storage BRIC, keep using original BRIC (new one cannot be used)

- **Documentation**:
  - ✅ Read and analyzed EPX BRIC Storage specification (19 pages)
  - ✅ Read and analyzed 3D Secure & 3rd Party Token specification (28 pages)
  - ✅ Documented conversion fee structure (business billing, not technical charge)
  - ✅ Documented Account Verification requirements for credit cards
  - ✅ Documented three BRIC Storage use cases:
    1. Create from account information
    2. Update existing Storage BRIC
    3. Convert Financial BRIC to Storage BRIC

- **EPX BRIC Storage Adapter** (`internal/adapters/epx/bric_storage_adapter.go`):
  - ✅ Implemented complete BRIC Storage adapter (522 lines)
  - ✅ `ConvertFinancialBRICToStorage()` - converts Financial BRIC with Account Verification

### Added - Browser Post Callback Endpoint (2025-11-03)

**Implemented EPX Browser Post REDIRECT_URL handler for transaction processing**

- **New HTTP Callback Endpoint**:
  - ✅ Created `/api/v1/payments/browser-post/callback` endpoint (POST)
  - ✅ Receives redirect from EPX with transaction results after payment processing
  - ✅ Parses response using existing `BrowserPostAdapter.ParseRedirectResponse()`
  - ✅ Validates and extracts AUTH_GUID (BRIC), AUTH_RESP, AUTH_CODE, and card verification fields
  - **Why**: EPX requires a REDIRECT_URL to send transaction results back to merchant
  - **Impact**: Completes Browser Post flow for PCI-compliant card tokenization

- **Transaction Storage**:
  - ✅ Stores transaction in database with AUTH_GUID for refunds/voids/chargebacks
  - ✅ Uses existing transactions table schema (no migration needed)
  - ✅ Handles guest checkouts (no customer_id or payment_method_id)
  - ✅ Implements duplicate detection using TRAN_NBR as idempotency key
  - **Why**: AUTH_GUID needed for post-transaction operations (refunds, disputes, reconciliation)
  - **Why Duplicate Detection**: EPX uses PRG pattern - same response may be received multiple times

- **User-Facing Receipt Page**:
  - ✅ Renders HTML receipt page with transaction details
  - ✅ Shows success/failure status with appropriate messaging
  - ✅ Displays masked card number, authorization code, and transaction ID
  - ✅ Provides error page for validation failures
  - **Why**: User sees immediate feedback after payment submission

- **Integration**:
  - ✅ Wired up handler in `cmd/server/main.go` alongside cron endpoints
  - ✅ Uses HTTP server on port 8081 (same as cron endpoints)
  - ✅ Dependencies: DatabaseAdapter, BrowserPostAdapter, Logger
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `internal/handlers/payment/browser_post_callback_handler.go` (new)
    - `cmd/server/main.go` (updated)
    - `README.md` (updated with REDIRECT_URL configuration)

- **REDIRECT_URL Configuration**:
  - Local Development: `http://localhost:8081/api/v1/payments/browser-post/callback`
  - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/payments/browser-post/callback`
  - **Action Required**: Provide this URL to EPX when configuring Browser Post credentials

### Fixed - Browser Post Dataflow Documentation (2025-11-03)

**Corrected BROWSER_POST_DATAFLOW.md to remove incorrect Key Exchange API references**

- **Removed Key Exchange API Step**:
  - ❌ Removed incorrect documentation of EPX Key Exchange API as part of Browser Post flow
  - ✅ Updated Step 1 to "GENERATE TAC TOKEN" with merchant-specific implementation note
  - **Reason**: User correction - "there is no key exchange api for north payment"
  - **Impact**: Dataflow documentation now accurately reflects the actual implementation

- **Clarified TAC Token Generation**:
  - ✅ Documented that TAC generation method depends on merchant's EPX credentials setup
  - ✅ Kept TAC contents documentation (MAC, REDIRECT_URL, AMOUNT, TRAN_NBR, etc.)
  - ✅ Maintained 4-hour expiration and encryption details
  - **Why**: Different merchants may have different TAC provisioning methods

- **Enhanced Financial BRIC Documentation**:
  - ✅ Added section documenting Financial BRIC token usage
  - ✅ Clarified current implementation (guest checkout: refunds, voids, chargebacks, reconciliation)
  - ✅ Documented future enhancement: Converting to Storage BRIC for saved payment methods
  - ✅ Noted Storage BRIC capabilities: recurring payments, card-on-file, never expires
  - **Why**: User clarification that BRICs can be used for recurring payments and saved methods

- **Updated Process Flow**:
  - ✅ Changed flow from 5 steps with Key Exchange to 4 steps starting with TAC generation
  - ✅ Maintained all EPX validation, processing, and redirect logic
  - ✅ Kept PRG (POST-REDIRECT-GET) pattern documentation
  - ✅ Preserved all component verification and testing checklists

### Fixed - Docker Compose and Migrations (2025-10-29)

**Fixed deployment issues and migration dependencies**

- **Updated Dockerfile Go version**:
  - ✅ Changed from `golang:1.21-alpine` to `golang:1.24-alpine`
  - **Reason**: go.mod requires go >= 1.24.9
  - **Impact**: Docker builds now succeed without version errors

- **Fixed migration dependency order**:
  - ✅ Reordered migrations: `customer_payment_methods` (001) now runs before `transactions` (002)
  - ✅ Moved `update_updated_at_column()` function to 001_customer_payment_methods.sql
  - **Reason**: transactions table references customer_payment_methods via foreign key
  - **Impact**: Migrations now run successfully in correct order

- **Fixed migration file format**:
  - ✅ Added missing goose markers to `007_webhook_subscriptions.sql`
  - ✅ Commented out pg_cron scheduling in `005_soft_delete_cleanup.sql` (optional extension)
  - **Reason**: Goose requires `-- +goose Up/Down` markers, pg_cron not available in standard PostgreSQL image
  - **Impact**: All 7 migrations now run successfully

- **Docker Compose Testing**:
  - ✅ Successfully built images with podman-compose
  - ✅ Both containers running: `payment-postgres` (healthy), `payment-server` (ports 8080-8081)
  - ✅ All 7 database migrations applied successfully
  - ✅ gRPC server responding on port 8080 with all 5 services available:
    - agent.v1.AgentService
    - chargeback.v1.ChargebackService
    - payment.v1.PaymentService
    - payment_method.v1.PaymentMethodService
    - subscription.v1.SubscriptionService
  - ✅ HTTP cron server responding on port 8081

- **Secret Manager Clarification**:
  - ℹ️  No separate container needed - uses local file-based secret manager
  - ℹ️  Reads from `./secrets/` directory (mounted in docker-compose.yml)
  - ℹ️  Production can swap to AWS Secrets Manager or Vault

### Changed - Simplified Project Structure (2025-10-29)

**Flattened directory structure and added secret manager support**

- **Moved `api/proto/` to `proto/`** - Flattened directory structure
  - ❌ Removed unnecessary `api/` wrapper directory
  - ✅ Now: `proto/payment/v1/`, `proto/subscription/v1/`, etc.
  - ✅ Updated all imports across entire codebase
  - ✅ Updated Makefile proto generation to include all 5 proto files
  - **Why**: Simpler, follows standard Go project layout
  - **Impact**: Cleaner imports, easier navigation

- **Added Secret Manager Support**:
  - ✅ Created `secrets/` directory for local development
  - ✅ Added to docker-compose.yml as read-only volume mount
  - ✅ Added to .gitignore (tracks directory, ignores secret files)
  - **Usage**: Local file-based secret manager for development
  - **Production**: Can swap to AWS Secrets Manager or Vault

- **Removed Temporary Test Script**:
  - ❌ `test_merchant_reporting.sh` - Manual test script (no longer needed)

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Simpler imports: `proto/payment/v1` vs `api/proto/payment/v1`
  - ✅ Secret management ready for development and production
  - ✅ Follows Go community standards

### Removed - Empty Legacy Directories (2025-10-29)

**Final cleanup of leftover empty directories from old architecture**

- **Deleted Empty Directories**:
  - ❌ `internal/application/` - Empty directory from old application layer pattern
  - ❌ `internal/api/` - Empty directory (confused with `api/proto/`)
  - ❌ `internal/repository/` - Empty directory from old repository pattern

- **Result**: Clean, clear directory structure with no confusion
  ```
  internal/
  ├── handlers/    # Presentation layer (gRPC/HTTP)
  ├── services/    # Business logic layer
  ├── adapters/    # Infrastructure layer (EPX, North, DB, Secrets)
  ├── domain/      # Domain entities
  ├── db/          # Migrations, queries, sqlc
  └── config/      # Configuration
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ No confusion between `internal/application/services` and `internal/services`
  - ✅ Clear separation of layers
  - ✅ Easier navigation and understanding
  - ✅ Follows standard Go project layout

### Removed - Custom Migration CLI (2025-10-29)

**Simplified migrations by using Goose CLI directly instead of custom wrapper**

- **Deleted `cmd/migrate/`** - Removed custom migration wrapper (95 lines)
- **Why**: The wrapper just read env vars and called goose - unnecessary abstraction
- **Benefit**: One less binary to build, simpler architecture, direct goose CLI usage

- **Updated docker-compose.yml**:
  - ✅ Now uses `ghcr.io/pressly/goose:latest` image directly
  - ✅ No need to build custom migrate binary in Docker
  - ✅ Cleaner, standard approach

- **Added Makefile migration targets**:
  - ✅ `make migrate-up` - Run pending migrations
  - ✅ `make migrate-down` - Rollback last migration
  - ✅ `make migrate-status` - Show migration status
  - ✅ `make migrate-create NAME=table_name` - Create new migration

- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  # Local development (via Makefile)
  make migrate-up
  make migrate-create NAME=add_users_table

  # Or use goose CLI directly
  goose -dir internal/db/migrations postgres "connection_string" up

  # Docker (automatic)
  docker-compose up  # Runs migrations automatically
  ```

### Updated - Docker Compose Configuration (2025-10-29)

**Updated docker-compose.yml and .env.example to reflect current EPX architecture**

- **docker-compose.yml Updates**:
  - ✅ Updated environment variables to match current architecture
  - ✅ Changed PORT from 50051 to 8080 (gRPC server)
  - ✅ Added HTTP_PORT 8081 for cron endpoints
  - ✅ Replaced old North payment vars with EPX_BASE_URL and EPX_TIMEOUT
  - ✅ Added NORTH_API_URL and NORTH_TIMEOUT for dispute reporting
  - ✅ Added CRON_SECRET for cron job authentication
  - ✅ Added ENVIRONMENT variable
  - ✅ Updated port mappings: 8080:8080 (gRPC), 8081:8081 (HTTP cron)

- **.env.example Updates**:
  - ✅ Complete rewrite to reflect EPX architecture
  - ✅ Clear separation: EPX for payments, North for dispute reporting
  - ✅ Added inline comments explaining each variable
  - ✅ Documented that North API is READ-ONLY for disputes
  - ✅ Added CRON_SECRET for webhook delivery authentication
  - ✅ Removed obsolete NORTH_EPI_ID, NORTH_EPI_KEY variables

- **PostgreSQL Already Configured**:
  - ✅ PostgreSQL 15 Alpine in docker-compose.yml (port 5432)
  - ✅ Automatic migrations via init scripts
  - ✅ Health checks configured
  - ✅ Persistent volume for data
  - ✅ Separate test database in docker-compose.test.yml (port 5434)

- **Quick Start**:
  ```bash
  # Copy example env file
  cp .env.example .env

  # Start all services (postgres + migrations + payment-server)
  docker-compose up -d

  # View logs
  docker-compose logs -f payment-server

  # Stop all services
  docker-compose down
  ```

### Removed - Aggressive Codebase Cleanup (2025-10-29)

**Major cleanup removing ~30% of codebase** - deleted dead code, duplicate models, and unused interfaces based on comprehensive audit.

- **Deleted Old North Payment Adapters** (13 files, ~121,000 lines):
  - ❌ `internal/adapters/north/custom_pay_adapter.go` + tests - Using EPX instead
  - ❌ `internal/adapters/north/ach_adapter.go` + tests - Using EPX instead
  - ❌ `internal/adapters/north/recurring_billing_adapter.go` + tests - Using EPX instead
  - ❌ `internal/adapters/north/browser_post_adapter.go` + tests - Using EPX instead
  - ❌ `internal/adapters/north/auth.go` + tests - EPX handles authentication
  - ❌ `internal/adapters/north/response_codes.go` + tests - EPX specific
  - **Reason**: Architecture shifted to EPX Gateway for all payment processing
  - **North Usage**: Only `merchant_reporting_adapter.go` remains (for dispute polling)

- **Consolidated Domain Models** (removed duplicate location):
  - ❌ Deleted `internal/domain/models/` directory entirely
  - ❌ Files removed: `ach.go`, `chargeback.go`, `payment.go`, `settlement.go`, `subscription.go`
  - ✅ Single source of truth: `internal/domain/` (agent.go, chargeback.go, payment_method.go, subscription.go, transaction.go, errors.go)
  - **Reason**: Two locations caused confusion and inconsistent imports

- **Removed Unused Domain Ports** (legacy interfaces):
  - ❌ Deleted `internal/domain/ports/` directory entirely
  - ❌ Files removed: `settlement_repository.go`, `ach_gateway.go`, `payment_gateway.go`, `subscription_gateway.go`, `payment_service.go`, `subscription_service.go`, `subscription_repository.go`, `chargeback_repository.go`, `transaction_repository.go`, `database.go`, `http_client.go`, `logger.go`
  - ✅ Active ports now clearly separated:
    - `internal/adapters/ports/` - EPX/North adapter interfaces
    - `internal/services/ports/` - Service layer interfaces
  - **Reason**: Old hexagonal architecture interfaces no longer align with current design

- **Architecture Now Cleaner**:
  ```
  Payments:  gRPC Handlers → Services → EPX Adapters → EPX Gateway
  Disputes:  Cron Job → North Reporting Adapter → North API (read-only)
  Storage:   Services → sqlc Queries → PostgreSQL
  ```

- **Impact**:
  - ✅ Reduced codebase by ~30% (from 93 to ~70 Go files)
  - ✅ Eliminated architectural confusion (one pattern, not mixed)
  - ✅ Faster builds (fewer files to compile)
  - ✅ Easier onboarding (clearer structure)
  - ✅ All tests still pass

- **Deleted Old Test Files** (testing deleted architecture):
  - ❌ `test/mocks/` directory - mocks for old gateway interfaces
  - ❌ `internal/services/payment/payment_service_test.go` - tested old architecture
  - ❌ `internal/services/subscription/subscription_service_test.go` - tested old architecture
  - ❌ `test/integration/payment_service_test.go` - tested old repository pattern
  - ❌ `test/integration/subscription_service_test.go` - tested old repository pattern
  - ❌ `test/integration/repository_test.go` - tested deleted postgres adapters
  - **Reason**: Tests referenced deleted `internal/domain/ports/` and `internal/domain/models/`
  - ✅ Remaining tests: `internal/handlers/chargeback/chargeback_handler_test.go` (11 passing tests)

- **Created New Adapter Port Interfaces**:
  - ✅ `internal/adapters/ports/http_client.go` - minimal HTTP client interface for adapters
  - ✅ `internal/adapters/ports/logger.go` - structured logging interface with field helpers (String, Int, Err)
  - **Purpose**: Clean abstractions for merchant_reporting_adapter and logger_adapter
  - **Benefit**: Easy mocking and testing without external dependencies

- **Audit Report**: See `AUDIT_REPORT.md` for complete findings

### Updated - Documentation Consolidation (2025-10-29)

**Major documentation restructuring** - consolidated 25+ separate markdown files into one comprehensive `DOCUMENTATION.md` in the root directory.

- **Created DOCUMENTATION.md** (root level):
  - ✅ Single source of truth for all payment service documentation
  - ✅ 12 major sections with clean table of contents
  - ✅ Covers: Introduction, Quick Start, Architecture, Integrations, APIs, Testing, Deployment
  - ✅ Updated chargeback documentation: Disputes handled online at North portal - we only READ chargeback data
  - ✅ Clarified webhook system: outbound notifications for chargebacks (not inbound payment webhooks)
  - ✅ Combined content from: SYSTEM_DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE_BENEFITS.md, FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md, LOCAL_TESTING_SETUP.md, CHARGEBACK_MANAGEMENT.md, WEBHOOK_SYSTEM.md, NORTH_API_GUIDE.md, PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md, and more
  - ✅ Removed outdated/redundant information
  - ✅ Consistent formatting and structure

- **Key Architectural Clarifications**:
  - **Chargeback Management**: READ-ONLY polling from North Merchant Reporting API
  - **Dispute Responses**: Handled online at North's portal (not via our API)
  - **Our Responsibilities**: Poll disputes → Store locally → Query via gRPC → Send webhook notifications
  - **North's Responsibilities**: Dispute management, evidence submission, resolution

- **Deleted Old Documentation Files**:
  - Removed entire `docs/` directory with 25+ outdated files
  - Deleted: SYSTEM_DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE_BENEFITS.md, FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md, LOCAL_TESTING_SETUP.md, CHARGEBACK_MANAGEMENT.md, WEBHOOK_SYSTEM.md, NORTH_API_GUIDE.md, PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md, FEATURE_CHART.md, IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, and 15+ more
  - **Result**: Clean root with only README.md, DOCUMENTATION.md, and CHANGELOG.md
  - Use `DOCUMENTATION.md` as the single source of truth

### Updated - Documentation Overhaul (2025-10-29)

Comprehensive documentation update to reflect webhook system, chargeback management, and simplified API.

- **Documentation Reorganization**:
  - Moved `WEBHOOK_SYSTEM.md` and `QUICK_START_WEBHOOKS.md` to `docs/` folder
  - All documentation now properly organized in `docs/` directory

- **Updated docs/README.md**:
  - Added webhook system and chargeback management to "Implemented" section
  - Removed webhooks from "Future Enhancements"
  - Added new environment variables: HTTP_PORT, NORTH_API_URL, NORTH_TIMEOUT, CRON_SECRET
  - Updated version to v0.2.0-alpha, last updated: 2025-10-29
  - Added links to webhook documentation in Quick Links

- **Completely Rewrote docs/DISPUTE_API_INTEGRATION.md**:
  - Changed status from "planned" to "FULLY IMPLEMENTED" ✅
  - Added complete architecture flow diagram
  - Documented actual field mappings to chargebacks table
  - Added webhook notification integration
  - Added gRPC API examples: GetChargeback, ListChargebacks with filters
  - Added Cloud Scheduler configuration and cron setup
  - Added monitoring queries, testing commands, troubleshooting guide
  - Removed all placeholder questions (authentication, field mapping, etc.)

- **Updated Root README.md**:
  - Added chargeback management and webhook system to features list
  - Updated test coverage statement to "85%+"

- **Simplified Chargeback API** (api/proto/chargeback/v1/chargeback.proto):
  - ❌ Removed `SearchDisputes` RPC - redundant with ListChargebacks
  - ❌ Removed `GetChargebackByGroup` RPC - use ListChargebacks with group_id filter
  - ✅ Enhanced `ListChargebacks` - added optional `group_id` filter parameter
  - ✅ Enhanced `GetChargeback` - added required `agent_id` for authorization
  - Reduced from 7 RPCs to 5 focused RPCs for cleaner API design

- **Implemented Simplified Chargeback Handlers** (internal/handlers/chargeback/chargeback_handler.go):
  - ✅ Implemented `GetChargeback` with agent authorization checking
  - ✅ Implemented `ListChargebacks` with flexible filtering (customer_id, group_id, status, date range)
  - ✅ Added pagination support with configurable limit (default 100, max 1000) and offset
  - ✅ Added helper functions: `convertChargebackToProto`, `mapDomainStatusToProto`, `mapProtoStatusToDomain`
  - ✅ Proper UUID conversion handling for pgtype.UUID fields
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 11 test cases covering success, validation, authorization, and error scenarios

- **Read-Only Architecture Cleanup** (2025-10-29):
  - 🧹 Removed unimplemented write operations from chargeback API
  - ❌ Removed `RespondToChargeback` RPC - North API doesn't support evidence submission
  - ❌ Removed `UpdateChargebackNotes` RPC - merchants respond via North web portal
  - ❌ Removed `SyncChargebacks` RPC - sync handled by cron HTTP endpoint
  - ❌ Deleted `internal/adapters/ports/blob_storage.go` - no S3/blob storage needed
  - ✅ Clarified API as read-only monitoring and notification system
  - ✅ Updated comments to explain merchants respond via North portal, not our API
  - **Architecture**: North API provides only `GET /merchant/disputes/mid/search` for dispute retrieval
  - **Workflow**: Cron job syncs disputes → Database → Webhooks notify merchants → Merchants respond via North portal

### Added - Outbound Webhook System for Chargeback Notifications (2025-10-29)

Implemented complete outbound webhook infrastructure allowing merchants to receive real-time notifications when chargebacks are created or updated.

- **Webhook Subscription Management**:
  - **Database Schema** (internal/db/migrations/007_webhook_subscriptions.sql):
    - `webhook_subscriptions` table: stores merchant webhook URLs per event type
    - Fields: agent_id, event_type, webhook_url, secret (for HMAC signing), is_active
    - Unique constraint ensures one active webhook per agent/event/URL combination
    - `webhook_deliveries` table: tracks delivery attempts, status, retries
    - Fields: subscription_id, payload, status (pending/success/failed), http_status_code, attempts, next_retry_at
    - Indices for efficient retry queue and delivery history lookups

  - **SQL Queries** (internal/db/queries/webhooks.sql):
    - CreateWebhookSubscription, ListWebhookSubscriptions, UpdateWebhookSubscription, DeleteWebhookSubscription
    - ListActiveWebhooksByEvent: finds subscriptions for specific event types
    - CreateWebhookDelivery, UpdateWebhookDeliveryStatus: delivery tracking
    - ListPendingWebhookDeliveries: retry queue management
    - GetWebhookDeliveryHistory: audit trail

- **Webhook Delivery Service** (internal/services/webhook/webhook_delivery_service.go):
  - **DeliverEvent**: sends webhook POST requests to subscribed merchant endpoints
  - **HMAC-SHA256 signature** generation using subscription-specific secret
  - HTTP headers: `X-Webhook-Signature`, `X-Webhook-Event-Type`, `X-Webhook-Timestamp`
  - **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff (5min, 15min, 35min, etc.)
  - **Asynchronous delivery**: non-blocking goroutines don't slow down cron jobs
  - **Delivery tracking**: records all attempts with HTTP status codes and errors
  - **RetryFailedDeliveries**: background job for retry queue processing
  - Configurable max retries (default: 5 attempts)

- **Event Types**:
  - `chargeback.created`: New chargeback detected from North API
  - `chargeback.updated`: Existing chargeback status or amount changed

- **Webhook Payload Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_type": "chargeback.created",
    "agent_id": "merchant-123",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-29T12:00:00Z",
    "data": {
      "chargeback_id": "uuid",
      "case_number": "CASE-001",
      "status": "new",
      "amount": "99.99",
      "currency": "USD",
      "reason_code": "10.4",
      "reason_description": "Fraudulent Transaction",
      "dispute_date": "2025-10-15",
      "chargeback_date": "2025-10-25",
      "transaction_id": "uuid (if linked)",
      "customer_id": "customer-123 (if available)"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Integration with Dispute Sync**:
  - Modified `DisputeSyncHandler` to inject `WebhookDeliveryService`
  - `createChargeback`: triggers `chargeback.created` webhook after DB insert
  - `updateChargeback`: triggers `chargeback.updated` webhook after DB update
  - `triggerChargebackWebhook`: helper builds event payload and delivers asynchronously
  - Webhooks don't block cron job execution (fire-and-forget with logging)

- **Security**:
  - Each subscription has unique secret key for HMAC signature
  - Merchants verify signature: `HMAC-SHA256(payload, secret)`
  - Timestamp header prevents replay attacks
  - Event type header allows routing before payload parsing

### Added - North Merchant Reporting API & Cron Job Infrastructure (2025-10-29)

Implemented complete cron job infrastructure for subscription billing and dispute synchronization, with support for both Cloud Scheduler HTTP endpoints and pg_cron SQL functions.

- **Merchant Reporting API Integration**:
  - **North Merchant Reporting Adapter** (internal/adapters/north/merchant_reporting_adapter.go):
    - Implements MerchantReportingAdapter port for North's Dispute API
    - SearchDisputes method calls GET /merchant/disputes/mid/search
    - Builds findBy parameter with merchant ID and date filters

    - Returns DisputeSearchResponse with disputes array and metadata
    - HTTP client with configurable timeout (default: 30s)
    - Complete error handling and logging via ports.Logger

  - **Chargeback Handler** (internal/handlers/chargeback/chargeback_handler.go):
    - **REFACTORED**: Now queries database instead of calling North API directly
    - Architecture: Cron job polls North API → stores in DB → SearchDisputes queries DB
    - Implements ChargebackServiceServer with SearchDisputes RPC
    - Validates agent_id required parameter
    - Queries chargebacks table using ListChargebacks and CountChargebacks
    - Converts optional timestamp filters (from_date, to_date) to pgtype.Date

    - POST /cron/process-billing endpoint for Cloud Scheduler
    - Accepts optional as_of_date and batch_size in JSON body
    - Authenticates via X-Cron-Secret header or Bearer token
    - Calls subscriptionService.ProcessDueBilling with configured parameters
    - Returns ProcessBillingResponse with processed/success/failure counts
    - GET /cron/health for liveness monitoring
    - GET /cron/stats for billing statistics (placeholder)
    - Comprehensive logging of all billing operations

  - **ProcessDueBilling Already Implemented** (internal/services/subscription/subscription_service.go:472-519):
    - Gets subscriptions due for billing based on next_billing_date
    - Processes each subscription via processSubscriptionBilling
    - Creates EPX transaction via Server Post adapter
    - Saves transaction record and updates subscription billing date
    - Handles failures with retry logic and status updates
    - Returns counts: processed, success, failed, errors array

  - **HTTP Dispute Sync Handler** (internal/handlers/cron/dispute_sync_handler.go):
    - POST /cron/sync-disputes endpoint for Cloud Scheduler
    - Accepts optional agent_id, from_date, to_date, days_back in JSON
    - Defaults to syncing all active agents for last 7 days
    - Calls merchant reporting adapter for each agent
    - Upserts chargebacks using GetChargebackByCaseNumber lookup
    - createChargeback for new disputes with full field mapping
    - updateChargeback for existing disputes with status updates
    - Returns SyncDisputesResponse with agent count, new/updated counts
    - Maps North API status to domain status (NEW→new, WON→won, etc.)

  - **SQL Queries Updated**:
    - GetChargebackByCaseNumber now filters by agent_id + case_number (chargebacks.sql:22-24)
    - UpdateChargebackStatus now updates multiple fields (dispute_date, chargeback_date, amount, etc.)
    - ListActiveAgents added for syncing all active merchants (agents.sql:63-66)

  - **Database Migration Updated** (002_chargebacks.sql):
    - Changed group_id to NULLABLE (allows NULL if transaction not found)
    - Changed dispute_date/chargeback_date from DATE to TIMESTAMPTZ
    - Changed chargeback_amount from NUMERIC to VARCHAR (preserve precision)
    - Added currency column (VARCHAR(3), default 'USD')
    - Removed amount check constraint (not applicable to VARCHAR)
    - Fixed index on case_number (replaced non-existent chargeback_id index)

  - **CreateChargeback Query Updated** (chargebacks.sql:1-16):
    - Added currency parameter to INSERT statement
    - Changed group_id to narg (nullable argument)
    - Properly handles all required fields (raw_data, evidence_files, etc.)

- **HTTP Cron Server Setup** (cmd/server/main.go:85-124):
  - Added HTTP server running on separate port (default: 8081)
  - HTTP endpoints registered:
    - POST /cron/process-billing
    - POST /cron/sync-disputes
    - GET /cron/health
    - GET /cron/stats
  - HTTP server runs in goroutine alongside gRPC server
  - Graceful shutdown with 5-second timeout
  - Added HTTPPort and CronSecret to Config struct
  - Environment variables: HTTP_PORT, CRON_SECRET

- **pg_cron Alternative** (internal/db/migrations/006_pg_cron_jobs.sql):
  - Enables pg_cron extension for scheduled SQL jobs
  - **process_subscription_billing() SQL function**:
    - Finds subscriptions due for billing (next_billing_date <= today)
    - Processes up to 100 subscriptions per run
    - Updates next billing date based on interval unit
    - Increments failure count on error
    - Changes status to 'past_due' after max retries
    - Returns processed/success/failure counts and error messages
  - **sync_disputes_placeholder() SQL function**:
    - Placeholder for pg_cron scheduling
    - Recommends using HTTP endpoint for actual sync
    - Could be enhanced with pg_net extension for HTTP calls
  - **Cron job schedules**:
    - process-subscription-billing: Daily at 2 AM UTC
    - sync-disputes: Daily at 3 AM UTC
  - **Management functions**:
    - get_cron_job_status(): View last run status of all jobs
    - disable_cron_job(name): Disable specific cron job
    - enable_cron_job(name): Enable specific cron job
  - **Production notes**:
    - Requires pg_cron extension (superuser or rds_superuser role)
    - On AWS RDS: add pg_cron to shared_preload_libraries and restart
    - Billing function is simplified - actual billing via HTTP endpoint recommended
    - HTTP endpoint has full business logic with EPX integration

- **Architecture Decision - Cloud Scheduler vs pg_cron**:
  - **Cloud Scheduler (Recommended for Production)**:
    - ✅ Full application business logic (EPX integration)
    - ✅ Better monitoring and alerting (Stackdriver, Datadog, etc.)
    - ✅ Easier debugging with application logs
    - ✅ Scalable (separate from database)
    - ✅ Retry policies and failure handling
    - ✅ Industry standard for cron jobs
  - **pg_cron (Alternative for Local Dev)**:
    - ✅ No external dependencies
    - ✅ Integrated with database
    - ✅ Simple for basic tasks
    - ❌ Limited to SQL operations (no direct EPX API calls)
    - ❌ Harder to monitor and debug
    - ❌ Database becomes critical for cron jobs
  - **Implementation**: Both options available, choose based on environment

### Technical Details

- **Cron Authentication**:
  - X-Cron-Secret header: Shared secret for authentication
  - Authorization header: Bearer token support
  - Query parameter (development only): Insecure fallback
  - Cloud Scheduler OIDC support (production): Placeholder for token verification

- **Billing Processing Flow**:
  1. HTTP endpoint receives POST request
  2. Authenticates request via secret
  3. Calls subscriptionService.ProcessDueBilling
  4. Service queries subscriptions due for billing
  5. For each subscription:
     - Get agent credentials and payment method
     - Build EPX request with stored payment token
     - Call EPX via Server Post adapter
     - Create transaction record
     - Update subscription (next_billing_date, failure_retry_count)
  6. Handle failures with retry logic
  7. Return summary with counts and errors

- **Dispute Sync Flow**:
  1. HTTP endpoint receives POST request
  2. Authenticates request via secret
  3. Get agents to sync (specific agent or all active)
  4. For each agent:
     - Call North Merchant Reporting API
     - Get disputes for date range
     - For each dispute:
       - Lookup by case_number + agent_id
       - Create new chargeback OR update existing
       - Marshal full dispute as raw_data JSON
       - Parse dates and map status
  5. Return summary with new/updated counts

- **Database Schema Updates**:
  - Chargebacks table: group_id nullable, currency added, dates as TIMESTAMPTZ
  - Supports chargebacks without linked transactions (group_id NULL)
  - Stores amount as string to preserve exact precision from North API
  - Raw_data JSONB stores full North API response for debugging

- **Deployment Configuration**:
  - Cloud Scheduler: Configure POST requests to /cron/process-billing and /cron/sync-disputes
  - Set X-Cron-Secret header to match CRON_SECRET env var
  - Recommended schedules:
    - Billing: Daily at 2 AM in merchant's timezone
    - Dispute sync: Hourly or every 4 hours
  - pg_cron: Run migration 006 to enable (requires superuser)

### Dependencies Added
- None (uses existing HTTP server infrastructure)

### Configuration
- HTTP_PORT: HTTP server port for cron endpoints (default: 8081)
- CRON_SECRET: Shared secret for cron authentication (default: "change-me-in-production")
- NORTH_API_URL: North Merchant Reporting API base URL (default: "https://api.north.com")
- NORTH_TIMEOUT: North API timeout in seconds (default: 30)

### Testing

To test the HTTP endpoints:

```bash
# Process billing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/cron/process-billing \
  -H "X-Cron-Secret: your-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"as_of_date": "2025-10-29", "batch_size": 10}'

# Sync disputes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/cron/sync-disputes \
  -H "X-Cron-Secret: your-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_back": 7}'

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8081/cron/health

# Stats
curl http://localhost:8081/cron/stats \
  -H "X-Cron-Secret: your-secret"
```

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ Server builds successfully with all changes
- ✅ HTTP server starts on port 8081
- ✅ gRPC server runs on port 8080
- ✅ Merchant reporting adapter compiles
- ✅ Chargeback handler compiles
- ✅ Cron handlers compile
- ✅ Migration file syntax validated
- ✅ All queries regenerated with sqlc
- ✅ Graceful shutdown works for both servers
- ✅ **Chargeback handler tests updated and passing**:
  - Refactored tests to use MockQueryExecutor instead of mocking North API adapter
  - Tests now verify database queries instead of API calls (reflects new architecture)
  - All 4 test cases passing: Success, MissingAgentID, DatabaseError, WithoutDates
  - Uses NewHandlerWithQueries constructor for clean dependency injection in tests

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to production with Cloud Scheduler configured
2. Configure Cloud Scheduler jobs:
   - process-subscription-billing: POST /cron/process-billing daily at 2 AM
   - sync-disputes: POST /cron/sync-disputes every 4 hours
3. Set up monitoring alerts for cron job failures
4. Test with real North API credentials
5. Monitor billing success rates and dispute sync accuracy

  - All handlers compile and build successfully

### Added - Soft Delete Implementation with pg_cron Cleanup (2025-10-29)

Implemented soft deletes across all tables with automated cleanup using pg_cron. Records are marked as deleted rather than immediately removed, providing a 90-day recovery window before permanent deletion.

- **Database Schema Changes**:
  - **Migration Files Updated**:
    - `001_transactions.sql`: Added `deleted_at` column to `transactions` and `subscriptions` tables
    - `002_chargebacks.sql`: Added `deleted_at` column to `chargebacks` table
    - `003_agent_credentials.sql`: Added `deleted_at` column to `agent_credentials` table
    - `004_customer_payment_methods.sql`: Added `deleted_at` column to `customer_payment_methods` table

  - **New Migration** (`005_soft_delete_cleanup.sql`):
    - Enables `pg_cron` extension for scheduled jobs
    - Creates `cleanup_soft_deleted_records()` function to permanently delete records older than 90 days
    - Schedules daily cleanup job at 2 AM UTC via cron.schedule()
    - Handles all 5 tables: transactions, subscriptions, chargebacks, payment methods, agent credentials

- **SQL Query Updates** (payment_methods.sql):
  - **New Query**: `MarkPaymentMethodVerified` - Minimal update query to mark ACH payment methods as verified after pre-note
  - **Updated Queries with Soft Delete Filters** (added `deleted_at IS NULL` to WHERE clauses):
    - `GetPaymentMethodByID`
    - `ListPaymentMethodsByCustomer`
    - `ListPaymentMethods`
    - `GetDefaultPaymentMethod`
    - `SetPaymentMethodAsDefault`
    - `MarkPaymentMethodAsDefault`
    - `MarkPaymentMethodUsed`
    - `MarkPaymentMethodVerified`
  - **Changed to Soft Delete**: `DeletePaymentMethod` now sets `deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` instead of hard deleting

- **Service Layer Changes**:
  - Fixed `VerifyACHAccount` (payment_method_service.go:340-347) to use new `MarkPaymentMethodVerified` query
  - Replaced removed `UpdatePaymentMethod` query with minimal update for `is_verified` field only

- **Database Indexes**:
  - Added partial indexes on `deleted_at` for all tables to optimize filtering soft-deleted records:
    - `idx_transactions_deleted_at`
    - `idx_subscriptions_deleted_at`
    - `idx_chargebacks_deleted_at`
    - `idx_agent_credentials_deleted_at`
    - `idx_customer_payment_methods_deleted_at`

- **Benefits**:
  1. **Data Recovery**: Soft-deleted records can be recovered within 90-day window
  2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of deletions with timestamps
  3. **Compliance**: Meets data retention requirements for PCI DSS and financial regulations
  4. **Performance**: Partial indexes ensure efficient filtering of active records
  5. **Automated Cleanup**: pg_cron handles permanent deletion automatically without manual intervention
  6. **Operational Safety**: Accidental deletes can be undone within recovery window

- **pg_cron Configuration**:
  - Requires `pg_cron` extension (superuser or rds_superuser role)
  - Production: Ensure extension is enabled in database
  - Cleanup schedule: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
  - Retention period: 90 days from deletion
  - Logging: RAISE NOTICE for each table's deletion count

- **Cleanup - Payment Method CRUD** (2025-10-29):
  - Removed unnecessary UpdatePaymentMethod SQL query
  - Removed DeactivatePaymentMethod SQL query (soft delete not needed)
  - Changed DeletePaymentMethod from hard delete to soft delete
  - **Design Decision**: Payment methods cannot be updated due to tokenization security
    - Card data stored at EPX (we only have tokens)
    - To "update" a card: delete old + save new tokenized card
    - Standard pattern for PCI-compliant card vaults (Stripe, Square, etc.)
  - Final CRUD: Create (Save), Read (Get/List), Delete (soft delete with 90-day retention), SetDefault

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - ✅ Server binary builds successfully (26MB)
  - ✅ All core services compile without errors
  - ✅ All handlers compile without errors
  - ✅ go vet passes on core packages (services, handlers, domain)
  - ✅ Database adapter initializes correctly
  - ✅ EPX adapters initialize with environment-based configs
  - ✅ Secret manager adapter complete and functional

### Technical Details

- **Handler Pattern**:
  - Each handler implements UnimplementedXXXServer for forward compatibility
  - Constructor injection of service dependencies and logger
  - Clear separation: Handler (API layer) → Service (business logic) → Repository (data)
  - All handlers use same error mapping pattern for consistency
  - Protobuf ↔ domain model conversion in dedicated helper functions

- **Error Mapping**:
  - Domain errors mapped to appropriate gRPC status codes:
    - `ErrAgentInactive` → `codes.FailedPrecondition`
    - `ErrPaymentMethodNotFound` → `codes.NotFound`
    - `ErrTransactionCannotBeVoided` → `codes.FailedPrecondition`
    - `ErrTransactionDeclined` → `codes.Aborted`
    - `ErrDuplicateIdempotencyKey` → `codes.AlreadyExists`
    - `sql.ErrNoRows` → `codes.NotFound`
    - `context.Canceled/DeadlineExceeded` → `codes.Canceled`
  - Internal errors logged but not exposed to clients
  - Consistent error messages across all handlers

- **Type Conversions**:
  - Decimal amounts: string (proto) ↔ decimal.Decimal (domain)
  - Timestamps: timestamppb.Timestamp (proto) ↔ time.Time (domain)
  - Enums: proto enums ↔ domain string constants
  - Metadata: map[string]string (proto) ↔ map[string]interface{} (domain)
  - Optional fields: proto *type → domain *type with nil checking

- **Server Configuration**:
  - Default port: 8080 (configurable via PORT env var)
  - Database connection pooling: 25 max, 5 min (configurable)
  - EPX timeout: 30 seconds default
  - EPX sandbox URL: https://epxnow.com/epx/server_post_sandbox
  - EPX production URL: https://epxnow.com/epx/server_post
  - Secrets stored in: ./secrets directory (development only)

### Added - One-Time Charging for Stored Payment Methods (2025-10-21)

- **ChargePaymentMethod() Implementation**:
  - Added `ChargePaymentMethod()` method to `RecurringBillingAdapter` (internal/adapters/north/recurring_billing_adapter.go:304-352)
  - Implements North's `/chargepaymentmethod` endpoint for one-time charges to stored payment methods
  - Independent from subscription billing - does not count toward subscription payments
  - Accepts `paymentMethodID` and `amount` parameters
  - Returns full `PaymentResult` with transaction details
  - Proper error handling and response code validation

- **Gateway Interface Extension**:
  - Updated `RecurringBillingGateway` interface (internal/domain/ports/subscription_gateway.go:68-70)
  - Added `ChargePaymentMethod()` method signature
  - Documented as independent from subscription payments

- **Architecture Documentation Updates**:
  - **Updated docs/NORTH_API_GUIDE.md**:
    - Corrected understanding: Recurring Billing API = "Stored Payment Methods API"
    - Added `/chargepaymentmethod` endpoint documentation
    - Updated "Browser Post vs Recurring Billing" decision guide
    - Updated all scenarios to use correct API (Special Cases, FAQ, Summary Table)
    - Fixed misinformation about token storage and API usage
    - Added comprehensive examples for on-demand charging

  - **Updated docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md**:
    - Marked investigation as RESOLVED (2025-10-21)
    - Documented North's three Recurring Billing API capabilities:
      1. Store payment methods (customer vault)
      2. One-time charging via `/chargepaymentmethod`
      3. Recurring subscriptions via `/subscription`
    - Added resolution summary with implementation details
    - Moved original investigation to collapsible details section

### Changed

- **Recurring Billing API Usage**:
  - Clarified that Recurring Billing API serves dual purpose:
    - Store payment methods securely (customer vault)
    - Enable both one-time AND recurring charges
  - Browser Post API remains for immediate checkout (no storage)
  - Recurring Billing API now recommended for all stored payment method scenarios

### Technical Details

- **API Endpoint**: `POST /chargepaymentmethod`
- **Request Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "PaymentMethodID": 12345,
    "Amount": 99.99
  }
  ```
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "Date": "2025-10-21T10:30:00Z",
    "GUID": "txn_abc123",
    "Amount": 99.99,
    "Code": "00",
    "Text": "Approved",
    "Approval": "AUTH123",
    "Successful": true
  }
  ```

### Key Insights

- User correction was critical: "Recurring Billing also works for one time payment I think recurring means a stored payment method"
- North's naming is misleading - "Recurring Billing" implies subscriptions only, but it's actually a stored payment method vault
- This discovery enables pay-as-you-go, variable recurring billing, and on-demand charging without PCI burden
- Eliminates need to store BRIC tokens in our database

### Changed - Server Configuration for PCI Compliance (2025-10-20)

- **Server Payment Gateway Adapter** (cmd/server/main.go:209):
  - Changed from `CustomPayAdapter` to `BrowserPostAdapter` for PCI-compliant tokenization
  - **Why**: CustomPayAdapter expects raw card data (JSON), BrowserPostAdapter uses BRIC tokens
  - **Security Impact**: Backend now NEVER receives or processes raw card numbers
  - **Frontend Integration Required**:
    - Frontend must use North JavaScript SDK to tokenize cards
    - Frontend posts card data directly to North → receives BRIC token
    - Frontend sends BRIC token to backend API (not card numbers)
  - **PCI DSS Scope**: Dramatically reduced - backend is out of scope for card data handling
  - **Adapter Features**:
    - Accepts BRIC tokens only (not raw card data)
    - Form-encoded requests with HMAC-SHA256 authentication
    - XML response parsing
    - All payment operations: authorize, capture, void, refund, verify
  - **Testing**: 19 comprehensive tests, 89% coverage

### Fixed - Test Issues (2025-10-20)

- **Test Database Configuration**:
  - Changed test database port from 5433 to 5434 to avoid port conflicts
  - Updated `docker-compose.test.yml` to use port 5434
  - Updated `test/integration/testdb/setup.go` default port configuration

- **Payment Service Test Assertions**:
  - Fixed incorrect status expectations in authorization tests
  - Changed `Authorize_Success` test to expect `StatusAuthorized` instead of `StatusCaptured`
  - Fixed error assertion pattern to use `errors.As()` instead of type assertion for proper error unwrapping

- **Subscription Gateway Integration Bug** (internal/services/subscription/subscription_service.go:91-95):
  - **Root Cause**: Gateway subscription ID was set in memory but never persisted to database
  - **Fix 1 - Service Layer**: Added `s.subRepo.Update(ctx, tx, subscription)` call after receiving gateway subscription ID from CreateSubscription gateway call
  - **Fix 2 - SQL Query** (internal/db/queries/subscriptions.sql:22): Added `gateway_subscription_id = COALESCE(sqlc.narg(gateway_subscription_id), gateway_subscription_id)` to UpdateSubscription query
  - **Fix 3 - Repository Layer** (internal/adapters/postgres/subscription_repository.go:134): Added `GatewaySubscriptionID: nullText(subscription.GatewaySubscriptionID)` parameter to UpdateSubscription call
  - **Fix 4 - Unit Test** (subscription_service_test.go:260-261): Added mock expectation for `Update` call in CreateSubscription_Success test
  - **Impact**: Subscription service can now properly persist and retrieve gateway-managed subscription IDs

- **Test Results**: All 19 integration tests now passing (100% success rate):
  - ✅ Payment Service tests (7/7)
  - ✅ Transaction Repository tests (5/5)
  - ✅ Subscription Repository tests (4/4)
  - ✅ Subscription Service tests (6/6)

### Added - Integration Testing Infrastructure (2025-11-09)

**Amazon-style deployment gate pattern with post-deployment integration tests**

- **Test Location**: `tests/integration/` (in payment-service repo)
  - Integration tests live with service code (industry best practice)
  - Tests run against DEPLOYED service (not localhost)
  - Acts as deployment gate before production

- **Test Structure**:
  ```
  tests/integration/
  ├── merchant/              # Merchant API tests
  │   └── merchant_test.go
  ├── payment/               # Payment processing tests
  ├── epx/                  # EPX adapter tests
  └── testutil/             # Test utilities
      ├── config.go         # Test configuration
      ├── client.go         # HTTP client
      └── setup.go          # Test setup helpers
  ```

- **CI/CD Pipeline** (Amazon-style deployment gates):
  ```
  Unit Tests → Build → Deploy Staging → Integration Tests → Deploy Production
                                              ↑
                                      POST-DEPLOYMENT GATE
                                      Blocks bad deployments
  ```

- **Integration Tests Workflow**:
  1. Service deployed to staging
  2. Health check waits for service readiness
  3. Integration tests run against deployed service URL
  4. Tests validate EPX integration, API endpoints, database operations
  5. Production deployment ONLY proceeds if tests pass

- **Test Configuration**: Environment variables
  - `SERVICE_URL` - Deployed service endpoint
  - `EPX_MAC_STAGING` - EPX sandbox MAC secret
  - `EPX_CUST_NBR`, `EPX_MERCH_NBR`, `EPX_DBA_NBR`, `EPX_TERMINAL_NBR` - Test credentials

- **Test Data**: Uses seed data from `internal/db/seeds/staging/003_agent_credentials.sql`
  - Test merchant: `test-merchant-staging`
  - EPX sandbox credentials (public test credentials)
  - Seeded automatically during deployment

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Amazon-style quality gate (blocks bad deployments)
- ✅ Standard structure (tests with code, not separate repo)
- ✅ Atomic commits (update code + tests together)
- ✅ Tests against real deployed environment
- ✅ Simple local development (one repo)

**Why this approach:**
Industry standard practice is to keep integration tests with service code. Separate test
repositories are only used for E2E tests spanning multiple services (future).

### Changed - CI/CD Pipeline with Deployment Gates (2025-11-09)

**Added Amazon-style deployment gate using integration tests**

- **Pipeline Flow**:
  ```yaml
  test (unit) → build → deploy-staging → integration-tests → deploy-production
                                              ↑
                                          DEPLOYMENT GATE
  ```

- **Integration Tests Job** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):
  - Runs after staging deployment completes
  - Waits for service health check
  - Executes integration tests against deployed service
  - Blocks production deployment if tests fail
  - Timeout: 15 minutes

- **Production Deployment**:
  - `needs: integration-tests` - Requires integration tests to pass
  - Only runs if all tests succeed
  - Amazon-style quality gate ensures production safety

**Deployment Gate Benefits:**
- ✅ Catches integration issues before production
- ✅ Validates real environment behavior
- ✅ Prevents bad deployments automatically
- ✅ Confidence in production releases

### Added - GitHub Secrets for Integration Tests (2025-11-09)

**EPX sandbox test credentials for integration tests**

- **New Secrets** (payment-service repository):
  - `EPX_MAC_STAGING` - EPX sandbox MAC secret
  - `EPX_CUST_NBR` - EPX Customer Number (9001)
  - `EPX_MERCH_NBR` - EPX Merchant Number (900300)
  - `EPX_DBA_NBR` - EPX DBA Number (2)
  - `EPX_TERMINAL_NBR` - EPX Terminal Number (77)

**Note**: These are EPX sandbox test credentials (public, safe to use). The same
credentials are also seeded in staging database via `003_agent_credentials.sql`.

**Total Secrets**: 13 (6 OCI + 3 OCIR + 2 DB + 5 EPX + 1 CRON + 1 SSH)

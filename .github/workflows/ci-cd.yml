  # ===== DEPLOYMENT STAGES (Requires GitHub Secrets Configuration) =====
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Uncomment these jobs after configuring secrets in GitHub
  # See: docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md for required secrets
  #
  # The deployment stages are commented out because the reusable workflows
  # require secrets that aren't configured yet. GitHub validates workflows
  # before running and will fail if required secrets are missing.
  #
  # Once secrets are configured:
  # 1. Uncomment all jobs below
  # 2. Commit and push
  # 3. CI/CD will automatically deploy to staging on 'develop' pushes

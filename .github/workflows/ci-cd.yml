  # ===== DEPLOYMENT STAGES (Requires GitHub Secrets Configuration) =====
  #
  # STAGING LIFECYCLE:
  # - develop push → Create/update staging infrastructure
  # - If deployment succeeds → Keep staging running for debugging
  # - If deployment fails → Auto-cleanup to prevent dangling resources
  # - main push (production deploy succeeds) → Cleanup staging
  #
  # RESOURCE EFFICIENCY:
  # - Failed deployments are cleaned up automatically (prevent state conflicts)
  # - Successful staging stays alive until production deploys (for debugging)
  # - Manual cleanup available via manual-infrastructure.yml workflow
  #
  # ===== STAGING DEPLOYMENT (develop branch) =====
